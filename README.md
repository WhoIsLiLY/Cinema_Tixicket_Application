# Tixycket - Cinema Management Application

Tixycket is a cinema management application developed using **C# .NET** with **Microsoft Visual Studio**. It is designed to provide an efficient and modern interface for managing cinema operations, tailored for both employees and customers.

## Overview

This application is similar to cinema management systems used by major cinema chains such as XXI. Tixycket streamlines the process of managing schedules, movies, studios, and ticketing for cinemas.

### Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Tixycket comes with a modern and intuitive UI/UX, ensuring ease of use for both employees and customers.
  
- **Role-Based Access**: Different roles, such as Admins, Cashiers, Operators, and Servers, have specific access and privileges within the system to carry out their respective tasks efficiently.

  - Manage studios, movie schedules, and ticket sales.
  - View and manage invoices and transactions.
  - Maintain customer records and manage their bookings.

- **Detailed ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)**:
  - The application is built on a well-structured database design, ensuring a clear relationship between entities like films, schedules, studios, customers, invoices, and tickets.
  - This allows for features such as adding new films, scheduling their showtimes, linking films to specific studios, managing genres and actors, and many more. Below is a simplified representation of the system's architecture.

The above ERD shows the complex relationships between different entities within the application. Each entity (such as **Films**, **Studios**, **Sessions**, **Customers**, **Invoices**, etc.) is connected logically to allow smooth management of the cinema operations. These entities store crucial information, such as movie titles, show schedules, and customer bookings, to ensure the application's efficient performance.
